# Lists
* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section < ol>number.
* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point rather than characters that indicate order < ul>.
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms < dl>.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

# Boxes
* Box Dimensions :width, height.
* Limiting Width :min-width, max-width
* Border, Margin ,Padding.
* White space ,Vertical Margin.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

# ARRAYS 
* An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
* Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero not one. 

# Decisions and Loops
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do  while. Each repeats a set of statements.
