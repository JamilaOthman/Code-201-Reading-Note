# Links
* Links are created using the < a> element.
* The < a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

# Layout
* < div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. 
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

 * WHAT IS A FUNCTION? Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements. 
* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job and may return a value.
