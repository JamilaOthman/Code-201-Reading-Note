# Introducing CSS
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors and declarations .
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page

# Decisions and Loops
* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
