# Why problem domains are hard?

# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
* An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

# Document Object Model
* The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
### THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE
* You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
* DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent .
* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.
* In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent and is a popular reason for using jQuery.
* Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
